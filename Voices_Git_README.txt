The Voices Git repository was created in order to separate the large speech files
from the source code. This way we will be able to delete the history of the Voices repository from time to time
while maintaining the full history of the source code. 

In order to include any speaker directory in Cotovia, just copy the corresponding directory (iago/ for instance) into
the directory data of the source code.
